**Hellow Everyone**
It`s repository about my study in **FUGAS**
I added 2 labs for final exam.
Labs:
- Vector
    - In this lab, I needed to create a vector class that had x and y fields, as well as "+" and "-" methods for the vector
- ZOO
    - In this laboratory, I needed to create an "Animal" class, which placed the "species" and "name" fields in itself, as well as the "Zoo" class in which there was a list of animals and methods for adding and removing animals from it
